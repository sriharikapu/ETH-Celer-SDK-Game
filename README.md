# Bears, Bulls, & Bufficorns

*3 legendary forces battle for crypto world domination - but who will be victorious?*  *Place your bets in this Celer Network multiplayer game.*

Bears, Bulls, & Bufficorns is an online multiplayer JavaScript game running entirely on the Celer Network via the [Celer SDK](https://celer-network.github.io/).

The game involves state exchange between the two Celer clients, and conditional payment functionality (as the losing player automatically sends ETH to the winner).

## Rules

  * Bear beats Bull (what goes up must come down)
  * Bufficorn beats Bear (a bear market is the best time to #buidl!)
  * Bull beats Bufficorn (people throw money at anything in a bull market)

## Usage

```
sh client1.sh
sh client2.sh
npm run client1
npm run client2
localhost:1234
localhost:1235
```
